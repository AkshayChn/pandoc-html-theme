# Overview

Prof. Y. Narahari's Electronic Lecture Notes on Data Structures and Algorithms is available as HTML and PDF.
Here we attempt to solve all the problems and programming assignments given in these notes. We also aim to add extra content and readings that help.

## Overview of Effort

There are a total of **135 problems** and **18 programming assignments**. We have marked their difficulties in the style of Don Knuth's TAOCP along the way. Below is a list of programming assignments.

1.	**Introduction** (11 problems)
2.	**Lists** (13 problems)
    * Sparse Matrix Package
    * Polynomial Arithmetic
    * Skip Lists
    * Buddy Systems of Memory Allocation
3.	**Dictionaries** (8 problems)
    * Hashing: Experimental Analysis
    * Skip Lists: Experimental Analysis
4.  **Binary Trees** (7+9+6 problems)
    * Huffman Coding
    * Comparison of Hash Tables and Binary Search Trees
    * Comparison of Skip Lists and Splay Trees
5.	**Balanced Trees** (4+5+14 problems)
    * Red-Black Trees and Splay Trees
    * Skip Lists and Binary Search Trees
    * Multiway Search Trees and B-Trees
6.	**Priority Queues** (12 problems)
    * Discrete Event Simulation
7.	**Directed Graphs** (11 problems)
